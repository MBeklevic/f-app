### Live Demo

### Warning
The API endpoint used in the project is using HTTP instead of HTTPS. Therefore, there is a problem on Live Demo. The solution of the problem is to allow insecure content for this site. To allow insecure content on individual sites within Chrome, click on the lock icon in the URL bar, then click 'Site settings'.

There you will see a list of various permissions the page has. Choose 'Allow' next to 'Insecure content'.
